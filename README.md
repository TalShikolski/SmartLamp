🌙 Smart Lamp Project

A smart lighting system based on Arduino / ESP32, designed to automatically adjust the brightness and color according to ambient light conditions and user preferences.
The system includes automatic and manual modes, PWM-based brightness control, and an LDR sensor that provides real-time feedback.

Key Features:
💡 Automatic light adjustment using LDR sensor feedback
🌈 RGB LED ring with smooth PWM transitions
🕹️ Manual control via web interface

Technologies Used:

Arduino / ESP32 (C/C++)

PWM and ADC signal processing

Smart control using Wi-Fi and WebServer

Goal:
To develop a smart, energy-efficient, and responsive lamp that demonstrates seamless hardware-software integration and real-time sensor-based control.
