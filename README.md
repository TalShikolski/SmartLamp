🌙 Smart Lamp Project

A smart lighting system built with Arduino / ESP32, designed to automatically adjust brightness and color based on ambient light conditions and user preferences. The system includes manual and automatic modes, PWM-based LED control, and a light-dependent resistor (LDR) for real-time feedback.

Key Features:

💡 Automatic brightness control using LDR sensor feedback

🌈 RGB LED or LED ring with smooth PWM transitions

🕹️ Manual control via buttons or web interface (depending on version)

⚙️ Configurable thresholds and operating modes

🔌 Power-efficient design and modular wiring

Technologies Used:

Arduino / ESP32 (C/C++)

PWM and ADC signal processing

IoT control (optional: Wi-Fi + WebServer / Home Assistant integration)

Electronics prototyping (breadboard + sensor interface)

Goal:
To create a responsive, energy-efficient, and interactive smart lamp that demonstrates hardware-software integration, sensor feedback, and embedded system design principles.
